# bulk_csv_pandadoc_mailer
I created this program for when you need to do a bulk document generation using PandaDoc (you could modify the code to work for other platforms like docusign). This will also send (email) the document for signing.

You must first create your template on PandaDoc and name the variables you will be using to auto-fill data. Then just read the comments in the code and adjust to fit your needs.
